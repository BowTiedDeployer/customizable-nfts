# Details customizable NFTs

The goal of the customisable NFT smart contracts is to allow for a customizable gaming experience by incorporating in-game items which can be either attached, detached or swapped. Depending on the nature of the game, players will be able to use these items for further personalization or for use in-game. When earned, players may use or transact these items freely without relying on an intermediary to facilitate it for them. The utility of this is not only for Gamefi, but for any artist/NFT creator that wants to create complex art.
